# Angsd redo of bigd windowed popgen stats

## Files

Assumes you have folder of bam files. In my case, these are on Farm at:

/group/jrigrp/hapmap2_bam/Disk3CSHL_bams_bwamem/

and are all named as LineName_LaneInfo.bam, e.g.

W22_FC6162CAAXX_4.bam

To run on different folder or different naming convention scripts will need to be modified.

## To Run

First, run merge.sh to merge bamfiles. May need to be modified (see above). This is because ANGSD treats each bamfile as an individual.
